Select Two Topics

Generate 1000 runs with random selection of sentences

So, we have 1000 semantic spaces

For the overlapping words between the two topics, and mark them as W

For each word in W, find the number of syssets it has. Plot a distribution
and find a cutoff point. 

Now we have list of W', which are probably polysemous words.

Sort then and select w1 ... w5, where w belongs to W'.

Find the N nearest words for w in each semantic space
